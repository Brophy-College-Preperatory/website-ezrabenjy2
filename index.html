  <p>Welcome to Benji Blanket Coverege University. In this edition we will go over Cover 2, Cover 3, and Cover 4. We will be reviewing what the corner has to do in every coverage and how it helps the defense. To begin, we will go over Cover 2. Two Safeties: There are two players called safeties who play deep in the field. They are like the last line of defense, ready to stop any big plays by the offensive team. Their job is to cover the deep parts of the field on both sides. Cornerbacks: The cornerbacks, who are closer to the line of scrimmage, also have areas to cover, but they focus more on the shorter routes. They make sure the wide receivers (the players catching passes) donâ€™t get open too easily. Zone Coverage: Instead of each player following a specific opponent everywhere, they are responsible for a zone of the field. If a player from the other team enters their zone, theycover them. All the defensive players need to work together. If the quarterback tries to pass it deep, the safeties jump in to cover that area. If the play is short, the cornerbacks can step up to defend that. So, in simple terms, Cover Two is like having two players watching over the back part of the field while others guard the nearby areas, making it harder for the other team to find an open receiver and score. </p>

  <p> There is nothing else very important about cover 2 </p>

  <p> Now we will go over cover 4, it is much simpler then cover 2 and 3. In cover 4 the safeties and corners all drop back to guard deep fourths of the field with the linebackers replacing their short zones.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> Cover 4 is one of the easiest and most reliable coverages to run in todays game, and is especially used to prevent big plays when time is low. </p>
